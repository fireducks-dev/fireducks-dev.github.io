We believe that acceleration has various values. In the age of cloud computing, the value is also increasing in the form of lower cloud costs and reduced CO2 emissions. Above all, it is a great feeling when a program you have written runs fast.
May the Acceleration be with you #
FireDucks is still under research and development, and there are still many areas for parallelization and optimization that we would like to do.</description></item></channel></rss>
