In this article, we introduce the acceleration techniques of &amp;ldquo;groupby&amp;rdquo; used in FireDucks.
The groupby operation is one of the most fundamental and important operations in tabular data analysis. We can use the groupby operation to obtain important statistical properties such as the mean and variance of the data. We can also combine it with other operations to obtain new features.
FireDucks optimizes based on data characteristics for fast groupby operations.</description></item><item><title>Import hooks: how to use FireDucks without modifying your programs</title><link>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/importhook/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 09:35:10 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/importhook/</guid><description>This is Osamu Daido from the FireDucks development team. In today&amp;rsquo;s developers&amp;rsquo; blog, I would like to introduce the import hook feature of FireDucks. This feature enables you to use FireDucks without modifying your existing programs at all.
I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to use hooks when running Python files on the command line and how to enable hooks in IPython or Jupyter Notebook.
What is an import hook? #
FireDucks behaves in the same way as the original pandas, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started by simply modifying an import statement as follows:</description></item><item><title>Using Python's fast data frame library FireDucks</title><link>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/nes_taxi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 08:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/nes_taxi/</guid><description>pandas is a library that provides functions to support data analysis in the Python programming language. NEC Research Laboratories has developed a library called FireDucks, a faster version of pandas.
Data Preparation #
The analysis is performed on the data of passenger history of cabs in New York City. The source of the data is as follows:
https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
To analyze large data sets, we downloaded and merged the &amp;ldquo;Yellow Taxi Trip Records&amp;rdquo; data from January 2022 to June 2023 from the above link.</description></item></channel></rss>
