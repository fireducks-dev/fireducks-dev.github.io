In today&amp;rsquo;s developers&amp;rsquo; blog, I would like to introduce the import hook feature of FireDucks. This feature enables you to use FireDucks without modifying your existing programs at all.
I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to use hooks when running Python files on the command line and how to enable hooks in IPython or Jupyter Notebook.
What is an import hook? #
FireDucks behaves in the same way as the original pandas, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started by simply modifying an import statement as follows:</description></item><item><title>Using Python's fast data frame library FireDucks</title><link>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/nes_taxi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 08:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fireducks-dev.github.io/en/posts/nes_taxi/</guid><description>pandas is a library that provides functions to support data analysis in the Python programming language. NEC Research Laboratories has developed a library called FireDucks, a faster version of pandas.
Data Preparation #
The analysis is performed on the data of passenger history of cabs in New York City. The source of the data is as follows:
https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
To analyze large data sets, we downloaded and merged the &amp;ldquo;Yellow Taxi Trip Records&amp;rdquo; data from January 2022 to June 2023 from the above link.</description></item></channel></rss>
